PLANS FOR FUTURE TAX-CALCULATOR DEVELOPMENT
===========================================

Near-Term Development Plans
---------------------------

The main near-term objective is to complete the transformation of
Tax-Calculator into a microsimulation model that conducts only static
analysis of reforms.  This involves the development of other modules
that can be used along with Tax-Calculator to conduct non-static
analysis that generates both aggregate and distributional reform
results.  At least three other modules are being planned:

1. [Partial-equilibrium behavioral-responses](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Behavioral-Responses)
capabilities have been completed,

2. Corporate-income-tax capabilities are being developed, and

3. Simple-growth-model capabilities are being planned.

Once Tax-Calculator can support these other modules in the USA tax
collection of the Policy Simulation Library, it is anticipated that
the public API of Tax-Calculator will be stable.

Long-Term Development Plans
---------------------------

In the long-term Tax-Calculator will be enhanced in the following ways:

1. Fix bugs in tax-calculation logic,

2. Add new policy parameters to enable simulation of new reforms,

3. Add historical policy parameter values as they become available, and

4. Update input data used by Tax-Calculator as they become available.
