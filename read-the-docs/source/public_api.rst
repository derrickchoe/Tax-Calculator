Tax-Calculator Public API
=========================

The Tax-Calculator's core capabilities are in the Python package
called taxcalc, the source code for which is located in the
Tax-Calculator/taxcalc directory tree.

Here we provide a high-level view of the **public API** of the taxcalc
conda package with links to the source code.  This high-level view is
organized around the modules in the taxcalc package.  Below is a list
of the taxcalc package modules (in alphabetical order) with
documentation about how to call each public class method and function.
There is also a link to the source code for each documented member.
However, it may be more convenient to access this list interactively
via the **alphabetical** :ref:`genindex` **of taxcalc members**.

**Developers who want to use Tax-Calculator capabilities in their own
projects should restrict themselves to using this public API.  All
other Tax-Calculator members are private and subject to change without
advance notice.**
