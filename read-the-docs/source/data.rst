Micro Data
==========

The Tax-Calculator simulates federal individual income and payroll taxes
for each tax filing unit in a sample. For revenue estimation, that sample
must be representative of the US population.

Description
-----------

This project commonly relies on a micro dataset that closely reproduces
the multivariate distribution of income, deduction and credit items in
2009, extrapolated to 2015-2026 levels in accordance with
`CBO forecasts`_ available in Spring 2016. It is intended to match similar
but confidential data used by the Congressional Joint Committee on
Taxation. The underlying dataset must be purchased from the Statistics
of Income division of the Internal Revenue Service. Additional
information on non-filers is taken from the March 2013 Current
Population Survey. 

The open source `taxdata`_ repository implements the extrapolation and
statistical match.
