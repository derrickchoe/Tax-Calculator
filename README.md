Developing Tax-Calculator
=========================

This document tells you how to begin contributing to Tax-Calculator by
reporting a bug, improving the documentation or making an enhancement
to the Python source code.  If you only want to use Tax-Calculator,
you should begin by reading the [user
documentation](http://open-source-economics.github.io/Tax-Calculator/)
that describes how to use Tax-Calculator on your own computer (without
doing any programming) and how to use the Tax-Calculator web application
called [TaxBrain](http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/).  If you want the most
flexibility in using Tax-Calculator on your own computer, read the [user
documentation](http://open-source-economics.github.io/Tax-Calculator/)
first and then read our [Cookbook of Tested Recipes for Python Programming
with
Tax-Calculator](http://open-source-economics.github.io/Tax-Calculator/cookbook.html).


What is Tax-Calculator?
-----------------------

Tax-Calculator simulates the US federal individual income tax
system.  In conjunction with micro data that represent the US
population and a set of behavioral assumptions, Tax-Calculator can
be used to conduct revenue scoring and distributional analyses of tax
policies.  Tax-Calculator is written in Python, an interpreted
language that can execute on Windows, Mac, or Linux.


Disclaimer
----------

Results will change as the underlying models improve. A fundamental
reason for adopting open source methods in this project is so that
people from all backgrounds can contribute to the models that our
society uses to assess economic policy; when community-contributed
improvements are incorporated, the model will produce different
results.


Getting Started
---------------

If you want to **report a bug**, create a new issue
[here](https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/issues)
providing details on what you think is wrong with Tax-Calculator.

If you want to **request an enhancement**, create a new issue
[here](https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/issues)
providing details on what you think should be added to Tax-Calculator.

If you want to **propose code changes**, follow the directions in the
[Contributor
Guide](http://taxcalc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributor_guide.html)
on how to clone the Tax-Calculator git repository.  Before developing
any code changes be sure to read completely the Contributor Guide and
then read about our [coding style](CODING.md) and [testing
procedures](TESTING.md).  The Tax-Calculator [release
history](RELEASES.md) provides a summary of past and current
development work.

If you are relying on Tax-Calculator capabilities in your own project,
be sure to read the definition of the [Tax-Calculator Public
API](http://taxcalc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_api.html).


Citing Tax-Calculator
---------------------

Please cite the source of your analysis as "Tax-Calculator release
#.#.#, author's calculations." If you wish to link to Tax-Calculator,

preferred. Additionally, we strongly recommend that you describe the
input data used, and provide a link to the materials required to
replicate your analysis or, at least, note that those materials are
available upon request.
