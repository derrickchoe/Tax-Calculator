Economic Assumption Files
-------------------------

This directory contains an example of an economic assumption file that can
be combined and modified to construct your own economic assumption files
that are stored on your local computer.

Such an economic assumption file can then be uploaded to the [TaxBrain
webapp](https://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/file/) along with policy reform
file for analysis, or be used on your local computer using the `tc`
CLI (command-line interface) to Tax-Calculator, as described in the
[user
guide](https://PSLmodels.github.io/Tax-Calculator/index.html#cli).

[This
document](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/assumptions/ASSUMPTIONS.md#how-to-specify-economic-assumptions-in-a-json-assumption-file)
provides access to a template economic assumption file and guidelines
about how to prepare your own assumption files.
