This directory contains an example of an economic assumption file that can
be combined and modified to construct your own economic assumption files
that are stored on your local computer.

Such an economic assumption file can then be uploaded to the [TaxBrain
webapp](http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/file/) along with policy reform
file for analysis, or be used on your local computer using
the tc CLI (command-line interface) to Tax-Calculator, as described in
the [user
documentation](http://open-source-economics.github.io/Tax-Calculator/index.html#cli).

[This document](ASSUMPTIONS.md) provides access to a template
economic assumption filea and guidelines about their preparation.
